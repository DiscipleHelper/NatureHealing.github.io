									<h2>Weight Executioner</h2>
									<p>I was referred to Dr. Spat by my best friend for chronic pain. Dr. Spat not only was able to treat my pain, but he was also able to improve my vitality through a customized detoxification program. I feel much younger, happier, and full of life. In addition, losing weight throughout the detoxification program was a plus for me.

										<h2>The Impossible Treatment</h2>
										<p>I thought that I'd never recover</p>
									</header>
									<p>My days are extremely uncomfortable and my nights are uneasy due to a number of minor medical issues. Since I was a teenager, I have suffered from chronic peripheral neuropathy, ulcerative bowel syndrome, and Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Vitamins and pills haven't helped, and I don't tolerate them. Conventional medicine has been treating these issues for years, but to no avail.</p>
									<header>
										<h2>An Act of Care</h2>
										<p>Somehow I've been miraculously healing</p>
									</header>
									<p>Dr. Spat suggested I try different meditation and allow him to use homeopathic medicine and acupuncture to treat me. I experienced relief after only a few treatments. Without experiencing any IBS or ulcer pain, I was able to eat and tolerate a wider range of foods. My peripheral neuropathy symptoms lessened, and I felt more at ease. I was taken aback by the outcomes, and each acupuncture session reduced my symptoms until my ulcerative disease and IBS were completely resolved. My body has been able to heal thanks to Dr. Spat, and the entire process has felt organic.</p>
									<header>
										<h2>Forever Grateful</h2>
										<p>I'm officially a reoccuring patient and friend</p>
									</header>
									<p>Dr. Spat recommended exercise and meditation to preserve my newly found freedom from IBS. I continue to exercise, meditate and when life is more stressful I see Dr. Spat again for acupuncture.</p>

									<h2>Miracle Worker</h2>
									<p>Miracle Worker. Dr. Tam Spat performs miracles. I had trouble walking for 2 months. I was stuck at home just sitting down on the chair day in and out and didn’t know what to do. Dr. Tam Spat came to the rescue, fixed my feet ailments, and helped me walk again. I still think he's a magician. He’s definitely a natural healer with his uplifting personality and his miracle works. Thank you Doc!</p>

									<h2>Chronic Savior</h2>
									<p>Amazing! Yes, and that is how I would like to describe my experience with Dr. Spat.  I had chronic knee pain for many years. My orthopedist surgeon recommended for a knee
										replacement. I didn’t want to have my knee operated on. I decided to see Dr. Spat as my last hope to avoid having surgery.  After several treatments, my knee was pain-free, I didn’t have to be in a wheelchair or use a walker, or cane for support.  Thank you Dr. Spat.

									<h2>The Cure to Insomnia</h2>
									<p>I’ve had insomnia for the past 6 years.  After seeing numerous physicians, trying many
										different medications with no results, I decided to try alternative medicine for my sleep
										problem.  I tried acupuncture with Dr. Spat and I slept eight hours the first night after the first acupuncture treatment.  I continue to see Dr. Spat for other ailments and with my recommendation so are my family members.

									<h2>My Final Breathe of Wisdom</h2>
									<p>Not everyone agrees that a naturopathic physician is a doctor.  I was skeptical about coming to see Dr. Spat. I had pancreatic cancer Stage 4, it had spread everywhere in
										my body.  I was having palliative care at my doctor’s office when a nurse working at the clinic told me that I should try alternative treatments. At first, I thought to myself she must be joking, and who would want to have “quack” medicine. I was reluctant to go see Dr. Spat, but then I had one last wish, and that was to attend my daughter’s wedding.
									</p>
									<h2>Dancing Happily At the end</h2>
									<p>I went to see Dr. Spat. He was very upfront with me from the beginning that he
										was not quite sure how I would be able to prolong my life so that I could dance at
										my daughter’s wedding. He came up with a customize program just for me, we did
										make some minor changes along the way.   The best new was that I was able to dance
										at my daughter’s wedding and saw her smile. I will forever remember Dr. Spat for
										his kindness and compassion. Peace, love.  God bless you Dr. Spat.</p>

									<h2>Sport Enthusiast</h2>
									<p>Boy! I was lucky to be able to find Dr. Spat to treat my shoulder pain from sport
										injury.  Dr. Spat was kind, professional, and very direct with a plan for treating my
										shoulder pain. I’m now pain-free.  Would highly recommend Dr. Spat for therapy.

									<h2>The answer to Cancer</h2>
									<p>I come to Scottsdale specifically to be under the care of Dr. Spat for naturopathic
										treatment. I was diagnosed with breast cancer.  After my surgery, I was
										experiencing chronic fatigue and anxiety. Dr. Spat was not only able to help me with my fatigue syndrome, but also improve my quality of life.

									<hr />
									<h2>No Surgery Needed</h2>
									<p>I had chronic lower back pain for many years. My PCP recommended for back surgery, but I am very reluctant to do so.  I was referred to Dr. Spat by a friend.  Dr. Spat explained to me about prolotherapy for chronic back pain treatments.  After several treatments, my lower back  pain had improved, and I was able to avoid having back surgery. 
									</p>

									<h2>Give him a chance</h2>
									<p>I met Dr. Spat at my PCP’s office while he was doing a rotation there. I was intrigued by his knowledge and understanding of Chinese medicine. I‘ve had insomnia for quite a long time and I did not want to get hooked on Ambien. I visited Dr. Spat’s office for a consultation and decided to try acupuncture treatment for my insomnia.  To my astonishment, I slept in the treatment room for 2 hours.  The staff had to wake me up. That was the best 2 hours I have ever slept.  Dr. Spat was able to treat my insomnia, and other medical problems that I had. Give Dr. Spat a chance, and he will help you get better.
