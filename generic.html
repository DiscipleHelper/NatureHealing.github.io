									<h1>Why I am a<br />
									Naturopath</h1>
									<p>At the youthful age of 20, brain cancer plagued me<br />
									Through Christ, I defeated cancer and death<br />
									And live to serve humanity</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Priest & Dad.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I turned away from life after I had gotten brain cancer. I was on the verge of tears and death.  During my childhood and adolescence as an immigrant, 
									I encountered death on numerous occasions. I believed I had reached the end when I heard the diagnosis and felt the throbbing pain and aches originating
									 from my head and mind. I never knew thinking could hurt so much. Little did I know, God Almighty was testing me. I was aware that there was far more 
									 significance and meaning to my life than passing away at the age of twenty without having a family of my own. I turned away from all stressful matters 
									 in my life, accepted defeat at the hands of cancer, took a loan and my scraps, and began traveling the world in a last-ditch effort to 
									 claim value in my short lived-life.  I saw the world as it truly was during this journey, Godâ€™s creation! I could feel the very burden
									  weighing on my soul being lifted up as I welcomed the Holy Spirit into my life. It was upon my return from Asia that I had learned from my physician that Christ healed my cancer and soul.
								</p>
								<p>I am here to aid and serve you as both a naturopathic physician and a human. I will treat you the same way that God has treated me, 
									with care and unconditional love. I have served in 3 wars, acquired a BS degree with a major in Respiratory Therapy, and a minor in Chemistry from Loma Linda University. I 
									later on received my doctorate degree in Naturopathic Medicine from a top five accredited naturopathic medical schools, 
									Sonoran University in Tempe, Arizona. My clinical rotations were conducted at 
									Sonoran Naturopathic Medical Center and numerous affiliated and local hospitals of the state, where I trained in three separate types of medicine: natural medicine, conventional medicine, and Traditional Chinese medicine. 
									I then underwent advanced training at Phoenix Institute of Herbal Medicine and Acupuncture. I served 2 years as a Physician member
									 on the Board of Director for Arizona Naturopathic Medical Association (AZNMA). For the last 6 years, I've been hand-picked and appointed by Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs and former Arizona Governor, Doug Ducey, as a Physician Board Member for the 
									 Arizona Naturopathic Physician Medical Board. I assure you that I consider every opportunity for healing in my field of expertise and health conditions do not go unnoticed.
